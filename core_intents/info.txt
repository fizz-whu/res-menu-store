I'll help you identify the key intents needed for a Chinese restaurant food ordering system using Amazon Connect and Lex. Here are the essential intents you should consider:
Core Ordering Intents

Categories (appetizers, soups, entrees, desserts)
Daily specials, chef recommendations
Dietary filters (vegetarian, gluten-free, nut-free)

Additional Considerations
You might also want to implement:

CheckIngredients - For allergy concerns
GetRecommendations - Suggest popular dishes
ScheduleOrder - Future order scheduling
JoinRewards - Loyalty program enrollment

Each intent should have well-defined slots (like dish_name, quantity, spice_level) and appropriate prompts to gather missing information. Consider implementing confirmation prompts for critical actions like placing or canceling orders.
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific intent or help you design the slot types and utterances for these intents?

# Lambda Function Usage Display Example

When you run the tool, you'll see a detailed summary of Lambda function usage like this:

```
============================================================
LAMBDA FUNCTION USAGE SUMMARY
============================================================

üîó DIRECTLY CONNECTED FUNCTIONS (2):
These functions are actively used by the bot

============================================================
```

## What This Tells You

### üîó Directly Connected Functions
- These functions are actually configured in your bot's intents
- You can see exactly which intents use them and for what purpose
- These are the functions you'll most likely want to modify
- **Only these functions are shown by default**

### üîç Potentially Related Functions
- These functions were found by name/description matching
- They might be related to your bot but aren't directly connected
- Review these to see if they should be connected to intents
- **Only shown when using `--include-fallback`**

### Default vs Fallback Mode

**Default mode (no flags):**
```bash
python lex_bot_manager.py
```
- Shows only directly connected Lambda functions
- Guarantees that all listed functions are actually used by the bot
- Cleaner output, focused on actual usage

**Fallback mode:**
```bash
python lex_bot_manager.py --include-fallback
```
- Shows both directly connected AND potentially related functions
- Helps find functions that might be related but not connected
- More comprehensive but potentially includes unrelated functions

### Hook Types
- **Fulfillment (üéØ)**: Runs after all required slots are filled, handles the final action
- **Dialog (üí¨)**: Runs during the conversation to validate slots and manage flow

## Component Selection Menu

When selecting components, Lambda functions show their usage inline:

```
Available Components:

1. [INTENTS] OrderIntent (Locale: en_US)
2. [INTENTS] MenuInquiryIntent (Locale: en_US)
3. [SLOTS] MenuCategory (Locale: en_US)
4. [LAMBDA_FUNCTIONS] OrderProcessorFunction (DIRECT)
    Used in:
      - Intent: OrderIntent (fulfillment) - Handles intent fulfillment (final action) [Locale: en_US]
      - Intent: OrderIntent (dialog) - Handles dialog management (slot validation, etc.) [Locale: en_US]
5. [LAMBDA_FUNCTIONS] MenuQueryFunction (DIRECT)
    Used in:
      - Intent: MenuInquiryIntent (fulfillment) - Handles intent fulfillment (final action) [Locale: en_US]
6. [LAMBDA_FUNCTIONS] RestaurantLexBot (INFERRED)
    Usage: Potentially related (name/description match)
7. Exit
```

This makes it easy to identify which Lambda function you need to modify for specific functionality!
